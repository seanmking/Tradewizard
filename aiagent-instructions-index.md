## Key Benefits

The AI Agent layer provides several key benefits:

1. **Persistent Context**: Maintains business context across interactions
2. **Proactive Monitoring**: Autonomously monitors for changes and opportunities
3. **Personalized Guidance**: Learns from patterns to provide tailored recommendations
4. **Timely Notifications**: Alerts businesses to important events and deadlines
5. **Autonomous Actions**: Takes actions on behalf of businesses based on their preferences

By following these implementation instructions, you'll create a sophisticated AI Agent that proactively guides SMEs through their export journey, monitors for changes that impact their business, learns from successful patterns, and takes autonomous actions on their behalf.
