# Behavior Engine Implementation - Introduction

The Behavior Engine implements autonomous monitoring and proactive actions, enabling the agent to detect changes in the environment and take appropriate actions without user intervention.

## Overview

The Behavior Engine consists of several autonomous monitors that continuously check for specific conditions and trigger appropriate actions:

1. **Regulatory Monitor**: Monitors for regulatory changes that affect businesses' export activities
2. **Certification Monitor**: Tracks certification expirations and sends timely reminders
3. **Market Opportunity Monitor**: Identifies new market opportunities based on business profiles
4. **Profile Monitor**: Tracks changes in business profiles and triggers relevant behaviors

Each monitor operates independently but coordinates through the event system to provide a cohesive agent experience.

## Implementation Structure

We'll implement the Behavior Engine in the following steps:

1. Create a Scheduler for managing temporal triggers
2. Implement individual monitors (Regulatory, Certification, Market Opportunity)
3. Create a central Behavior Engine class to coordinate all monitors
4. Set up database indexes for efficient monitoring

Let's start with the Scheduler implementation.
