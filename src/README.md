# TradeWizard AI Agent: Streamlined Implementation

This directory contains the streamlined implementation of the TradeWizard AI Agent, focusing on high-value essentials while maintaining alignment with the comprehensive architecture.

## Overview

The TradeWizard AI Agent transforms the platform into a proactive export partner through a phased implementation strategy that focuses on the most impactful features first.

## Core Architecture

The streamlined AI Agent maintains the six key components from the comprehensive architecture, but with a focused implementation:

1. **Agent Core**: Simplified orchestration focusing on essential business workflows.
2. **State Manager**: Minimalist state tracking for critical business attributes.
3. **Event System**: Focused event processing for regulatory and certification events.
4. **Memory Subsystem**: Basic pattern recognition for industry-specific guidance.
5. **Behavior Engine**: Prioritized monitoring of essential regulatory requirements.
6. **Notification Service**: Action-oriented notifications with clear next steps.

## Implementation Phases

The implementation is divided into three phases:

### Phase 1: Essential State & Regulatory Foundation (8 weeks)

- Basic State Manager
- Simplified Regulatory Monitor
- Timeline Generator

### Phase 2: Market Intelligence & Proactive Guidance (8 weeks)

- Streamlined Market Reports
- Certification Monitor
- Action Sequencer

### Phase 3: Learning & Optimization (6 weeks)

- Simple Pattern Recognition
- Agent Dashboard
- Feedback Collection

## Key Features

### Streamlined Market Reports

- **Market Size**: Single clear metric (annual market value in USD/ZAR)
- **Growth Rate**: Simple percentage for 3-year trend
- **Key Entry Requirements**: 3-5 bullet points of absolute essentials
- **Competitive Landscape**: Simple categorization (highly competitive, moderately competitive, emerging opportunity)
- **Tariff Information**: Clear single percentage for primary product category

### Regulatory Requirements

- **Must-Have Documents**: Clearly separated from "nice-to-have"
- **Specific Issuing Authorities**: Direct links/contacts where available
- **Estimated Timeline**: Concrete processing times for each document
- **Dependency Tree**: Simple visualization showing which documents depend on others
- **Cost Estimates**: Transparent fee structures for each requirement

### Business Readiness

- **Current State Assessment**: Simple green/yellow/red indicators for key readiness factors
- **Sequential Action Plan**: Numbered steps in required order
- **Timeline Visualization**: Gantt-style chart showing critical path
- **Progress Tracking**: Simple percentage complete per requirement area
- **Priority Flags**: Clear indicators for urgent vs. flexible tasks

## Usage

To use the streamlined AI Agent, import the components from the `streamlined-index.ts` file:

```typescript
import { 
  StreamlinedAgentCore,
  StreamlinedStateManager,
  StreamlinedEventSystem,
  StreamlinedNotificationService
} from './agent/streamlined-index';
import { Database } from './database/connection';

// Initialize the database
const db = new Database();
await db.connect();

// Initialize the agent core
const agentCore = new StreamlinedAgentCore(db);
await agentCore.initialize();

// Handle a request
const response = await agentCore.handleRequest({
  businessId: 'business-123',
  type: 'SELECT_TARGET_MARKET',
  data: {
    country: 'Germany'
  }
});

console.log(response);
```

## Technical Implementation Priorities

### Data Minimalism

- Limit database collections to essential business attributes
- Store only actionable regulatory requirements
- Maintain focused market intelligence data

### Notification Design

- Limit notifications to actionable items only
- Include clear next steps in every notification
- Use priority levels consistently

### Report Templates

- Create standardized, simple templates with consistent information hierarchy
- Limit charts/visualizations to 2-3 per report
- Use consistent metrics across all market reports

### Timeline Management

- Implement clear dependencies between regulatory requirements
- Create realistic time estimates based on official processing times
- Build buffer periods into timeline calculations
