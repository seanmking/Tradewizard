# TradeWizard AI Agent Implementation Instructions

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive instructions for implementing the AI Agent layer of TradeWizard 2.0. The AI Agent transforms the platform from a reactive tool into a proactive export partner that helps SMEs navigate international trade.

The Agent's autonomous capabilities represent a significant evolution from the existing middleware architecture, enabling persistent context, proactive monitoring, and intelligent guidance throughout the export journey.

## Core Agent Architecture

The AI Agent layer consists of six key components:

1. **Agent Core**: Central orchestration component that manages the overall agent behavior and coordinates between different components.

2. **State Manager**: Maintains persistent business context across interactions, tracking business profiles, export journeys, and preferences.

3. **Event System**: Processes triggers and initiates autonomous behaviors, enabling the agent to respond to changes in the environment.

4. **Memory Subsystem**: Tracks patterns and learns from successful strategies, improving recommendations over time.

5. **Behavior Engine**: Implements autonomous monitoring and proactive actions, such as regulatory monitoring and market opportunity detection.

6. **Notification Service**: Manages communication with users, delivering timely and relevant information.

Each component plays a critical role in creating an intelligent, autonomous agent that can proactively assist businesses in their export journey.
