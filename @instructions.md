# Export Intelligence Scraper: Development Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for our Export Market Intelligence Scraper Framework. The framework is designed to collect competitor and customer data for SMEs looking to export, regardless of their industry or target market.

## Development Phases & Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)
*Highest priority - foundation for everything else*

1. **Network Layer**
   - Implement robust fetching with retries and proxies
   - Add rate limiting and robots.txt compliance
   - Build async capability for parallel operations

2. **Storage Layer**
   - Design database schema with scalability in mind
   - Implement resource management for connections
   - Add data validation and sanitization

```python
class NetworkManager:
    def __init__(self, config, proxies=None):
        self.config = config
        self.proxies = proxies or []
        self.user_agents = UserAgent()
        self.rate_limiters = {}  # Domain-specific rate limiters
        
    async def fetch(self, url, method="GET", retry_count=3):
        """Fetch URL with full resilience stack"""
        domain = urlparse(url).netloc
        
        # Check robots.txt
        if not self._can_fetch(url):
            return {"success": False, "error": "Blocked by robots.txt"}
            
        # Apply rate limiting
        await self._respect_rate_limit(domain)
        
        # Fetch with retry logic
        result = await self._fetch_with_retry(url, method, retry_count)
        return result
```

### Phase 2: Data Extraction & Processing (Weeks 3-4)
*Second priority - core business logic*

1. **Scraper Component**
   - Build modular extraction patterns by industry
   - Add structure detection and adaptive parsing
   - Implement HTML fingerprinting for change detection

2. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Create extraction, validation, transformation pipeline
   - Add entity detection and relationship mapping
   - Implement incremental processing for large sites

```python
class AdaptiveExtractor:
    def __init__(self, industry_patterns=None):
        self.patterns = industry_patterns or {}
        self.learned_patterns = {}
        
    def extract_products(self, html, url, industry):
        """Extract products with adaptive pattern recognition"""
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
        
        # Try known patterns first
        products = self._extract_with_known_patterns(soup, industry)
        
        # If insufficient results, try learning patterns
        if len(products) < 3:
            self._learn_patterns(soup, url, industry)
            products = self._extract_with_learned_patterns(soup, industry)
            
        return products
```

### Phase 3: Analysis & Reporting (Weeks 5-6)
*Third priority - delivers business value from collected data*

   - Implement export to various formats

3. **Regional Market Intelligence Integration**
   - Combine product/pricing data with regional market conditions
   - Integrate regulatory requirements for each target market
   - Analyze distribution channel effectiveness by region
   - Develop cross-market comparison capabilities

```python
class MarketAnalysisEngine:
    def __init__(self, db_manager):
        self.db = db_manager
        
    def analyze_price_positioning(self, market, product_category):
        """Analyze product pricing across market segments"""
        # Get pricing data
        products = self.db.query_products(market=market, category=product_category)
        
        # Group by company type (competitor vs customer)
        competitor_prices = [p['price'] for p in products if p['entity_type'] == 'competitor']
        customer_prices = [p['price'] for p in products if p['entity_type'] == 'customer']
        
        # Statistical analysis
        analysis = {
            "competitor_stats": self._calculate_price_stats(competitor_prices),
            "customer_stats": self._calculate_price_stats(customer_prices),
            "price_gap": self._analyze_price_gap(competitor_prices, customer_prices),
            "positioning_recommendation": self._recommend_pricing(competitor_prices, customer_prices)
        }
        
        return analysis
        
    def integrate_regional_data(self, market, industry_data, product_data):
        """Integrate competitor product data with regional market information"""
        # Fetch regional market regulations and conditions
        market_regulations = self._fetch_market_regulations(market)
        distribution_channels = self._analyze_distribution_channels(market)
        market_trends = self._get_market_trends(market, industry_data["industry"])
        
        # Combine with product/competitor data
        integrated_analysis = {
            "pricing_strategy": self._develop_pricing_strategy(product_data, market_trends),
            "regulatory_compliance": self._assess_compliance_requirements(product_data, market_regulations),
            "distribution_recommendation": self._recommend_distribution_channels(product_data, distribution_channels),
            "competitive_positioning": self._analyze_competitive_landscape(product_data, market_trends)
        }
        
        return integrated_analysis
```

            "requests": Counter(),
            "failures": Counter(),
            "extracted_products": Counter(),
            "processing_time": Summary()
        }
        
    def record_request(self, domain, success, duration):
        """Record metrics about a web request"""
        self.metrics["requests"].inc({"domain": domain})
        if not success:
            self.metrics["failures"].inc({"domain": domain})
        self.metrics["processing_time"].observe({"domain": domain}, duration)
        
    def generate_health_report(self):
        """Generate a health report for the scraper"""
        return {
            "total_requests": self.metrics["requests"].value(),
            "failure_rate": self.metrics["failures"].value() / max(1, self.metrics["requests"].value()),
            "avg_processing_time": self.metrics["processing_time"].sum() / max(1, self.metrics["processing_time"].count()),
            "extracted_products": self.metrics["extracted_products"].value()
        }
```

## Technical Debt & TODOs

### Architecture Concerns

```python
# TODO: Refactor into a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
# Trade-off: Current monolithic design enables faster initial development but will become unmaintainable as complexity grows
```

### Error Handling & Resilience

```python
# TODO: Implement proper error boundaries and recovery mechanisms
# Trade-off: Simple try/except blocks work for development but will lose data in production scenarios
```

### Resource Management

```python
# TODO: Implement proper resource management with context managers
# Trade-off: Current approach is simpler but could lead to resource leaks
```

### Scraping Reliability

```python
# TODO: Implement HTML fingerprinting to detect layout changes in target sites
# Technical debt: Current selectors will break when websites change their structure
```

### Performance Bottlenecks

```python
# TODO: Implement asynchronous processing for network operations
# Technical debt: Sequential processing won't scale beyond a few dozen sites
```

### Scalability Limitations

```python
# TODO: Implement data partitioning and sharding for scalability
# Technical debt: Single SQLite file doesn't scale for large datasets
```

### Security Concerns

```python
# TODO: Implement proper security controls for API keys and sensitive data
# Technical debt: Credentials in config files is insecure
```

### Anti-Scraping Measures

```python
# TODO: Handle anti-scraping measures including JavaScript challenges and CAPTCHAs
# Technical debt: Current implementation will fail on sites with sophisticated protection
```

### Content Type Handling

```python
# TODO: Implement content-type checking and handle non-HTML responses
# Technical debt: Current implementation assumes HTML responses
```

### Regional Market Integration

```python
# TODO: Develop sources for regional market data and regulatory information
# Technical debt: Relying solely on scraped data without authoritative regional information creates incomplete analysis
```
