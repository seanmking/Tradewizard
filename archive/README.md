# Archived TradeKing Export Assessment Code

This directory contains the original implementation of the TradeKing Export Assessment platform. The code has been archived as part of a simplification effort but contains valuable components that may be referenced:

## Notable Components

### Backend
- `backend/services/llm_service.py`: Comprehensive LLM integration with business validation
- `backend/mock_data/`: Detailed mock data structures for testing
- `backend/tradekingbackend/routes/`: Original route handlers and business logic

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/components/ChatInput.tsx`: Reusable chat input with autofocus
- `frontend/src/components/BusinessValidation/`: Business validation UI components
- `frontend/src/services/`: API integration and state management

## Usage

This code is kept for reference purposes. If you need to reuse any components:

1. Review the specific component in the archived code
2. Copy only the necessary parts to the new implementation
3. Simplify and adapt the code to fit the new architecture

## Original Structure

The original implementation used a more complex architecture with:
- Multiple route handlers
- Separate services for different functionalities
- Comprehensive state management
- Detailed mock data structures

The new implementation simplifies this while maintaining core functionality.
