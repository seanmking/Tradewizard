# Project Milestones and Progress Tracking

## Current State
- Feature flag system implemented
- Verification service updated to support mock/real modes
- Analyzed both BusinessValidationForm implementations
- Identified key differences and features to preserve

## Completed Milestones
1. Created feature flag system for mock/real functionality toggle
2. Analyzed component duplications
3. Created unified verification service with mock/real support

## Pending Tasks (Prioritized)

### Phase 1: Frontend Organization (High Priority)
1. **Business Validation Component Consolidation** (IN PROGRESS)
   - [x] Analyze both BusinessValidationForm implementations
   - [x] Create feature flag system
   - [x] Update verification service for mock/real modes
   - [ ] Create unified component preserving both mock and real functionality
   - [ ] Update tests to cover both modes
   - Files affected:
     - `frontend/src/components/BusinessValidationForm.tsx`
     - `frontend/src/components/BusinessValidation/BusinessValidationForm.tsx`
     - `frontend/src/config/features.ts` (Created)
     - `frontend/src/services/verificationService.ts` (Updated)

2. **TypeScript Standardization**
   - [ ] Convert InputForm.jsx to TypeScript
   - [ ] Resolve App.jsx/App.tsx duplication
   - [ ] Update related imports
   - Files affected:
     - `frontend/src/components/Chat/InputForm.jsx`
     - `frontend/src/App.jsx`
     - `frontend/src/App.tsx`

### Phase 2: Backend Organization (Medium Priority)
1. **Utility Organization**
   - [ ] Create utils directory structure
   - [ ] Move and refactor utility files
   - [ ] Update imports
   - Files affected:
     - `backend/personal_info_parser.py`
     - `backend/template_manager.py`
     - `backend/llm_service.py`

2. **Service Layer Organization**
   - [ ] Organize service layer
   - [ ] Separate mock and real implementations
   - [ ] Update imports
   - Files affected:
     - `backend/assessment_flow.py`
     - `backend/questions.py`

### Phase 3: Testing and Documentation (Medium Priority)
1. **Test Coverage**
   - [ ] Update/create tests for consolidated components
   - [ ] Ensure mock/real mode testing
   - [ ] Integration tests for reorganized backend

2. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Update README with new structure
   - [ ] Document mock/real mode usage
   - [ ] API documentation updates

### Phase 4: Cleanup and Optimization (Lower Priority)
1. **Code Cleanup**
   - [ ] Remove unused imports
   - [ ] Clean up dependencies
   - [ ] Remove duplicate code

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Review and optimize component renders
   - [ ] Review API calls and caching

## Implementation Notes
- Feature flags implemented to toggle between mock and real functionality
- BusinessValidationForm in BusinessValidation/ directory has more features
- Need to preserve both simple and advanced validation capabilities
- Verification service now supports both mock and real modes with consistent interface

## Current Issues/Risks
1. Maintaining mock functionality while implementing real features
2. Ensuring no service disruption during reorganization
3. Test coverage during transition
4. Dependencies between components
5. TypeScript linting errors in verification service need resolution

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Fix TypeScript linting errors in verification service
2. Create unified BusinessValidationForm component
3. Update tests for new verification service
4. Create unified test suite
