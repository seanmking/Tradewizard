# Export Assessment Platform - Phase 1 Implementation Guide

## Overview
Phase 1 focuses on achieving a reliable, end-to-end assessment flow with basic functionality. The goal is to complete one full assessment without hallucination, with reliable response capture and a consistent conversation style.

## System Architecture (Phase 1)
